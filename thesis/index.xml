      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This dissertation presents a study of choice functions as a tool to model uncertainty.&#xA;Choice functions constitute a very general uncertainty model that is capable of representing a rich variety of types of beliefs.&#xA;In particular, it includes as a special case &lt;em&gt;sets of desirable gambles&lt;/em&gt;, the most general binary—or pairwise—choice model in imprecise probabilities.&#xA;So the field of this dissertation is `imprecise probabilities&amp;rsquo;, which is an umbrella term for mathematical models that are meant to be used in situations of imprecise or incomplete information, where it may not be possible (or advisable) to use (precise) probabilities.&#xA;With our coherent choice functions, we want to be able to do everything that can be done within imprecise probabilities, such as conservative reasoning, updating and conditioning, and also to cope with structural judgements such as independence and exchangeability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
