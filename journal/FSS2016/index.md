## Abstract
We provide representation theorems for both ﬁnite and countable sequences of ﬁnite-valued random variables that are considered to be partially exchangeable.
In their most general form, our results are presented in terms of sets of desirable gambles, a very general framework for modelling uncertainty.
Its key advantages are that it allows for imprecision, is more expressive than almost every other imprecise-probabilistic framework and makes conditioning on events with (lower) probability zero non-problematic.
We translate our results to more conventional, although less general frameworks as well: lower previsions, linear previsions and probability measures.
The usual, precise-probabilistic representation theorems for partially exchangeable random variables are obtained as special cases.
