      <title>The law of iterated expectation and imprecise probabilities</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The law of iterated expectation tells us how to combine hierarchical pieces of information when our uncertainty is modelled by means of probability measures. It has been extended to the imprecise case through Walley&amp;rsquo;s marginal extension theorem for coherent lower previsions. In this paper, we&#xA;investigate the extent to which a similar result can be established for other imprecise probability models that are either more general (choice functions) or more particular (possibility measures, belief functions) than coherent lower previsions. By doing this, we also establish links with other results established in the literature in the context of imprecise versions of Jeffrey&amp;rsquo;s rule.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The logic behind desirable sets of things, and its filter representation</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We identify the (filter representation of the) logic behind the recent theory of coherent sets of desirable (sets of) things, which generalise coherent sets of desirable (sets of) gambles as well as coherent choice functions, and show that this identification allows us to establish various representation results for such coherent models in terms of simpler ones.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Inferring from an imprecise Plackett–Luce model: Application to label ranking</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Plackett–Luce model is a popular parametric probabilistic model to define distributions between rankings of objects, modelling for instance observed preferences of users or ranked performances of algorithms.&#xA;Since such observations may be scarce (users may provide partial preferences, or not all algorithms are run for a given experiment), it may be useful to consider the case where the parameters of the Plackett–Luce model are imprecisely known.&#xA;In this paper, we first introduce the imprecise Plackett–Luce model, induced by a set of parameters (for instance, parameters with a high relative likelihood).&#xA;Given a set of possible parameters for the model, we then provide an efficient algorithm to make cautious inferences, returning sets of possible optimal rankings (for instance in the form of partial orders).&#xA;We illustrate the use of our imprecise model on label ranking, a specific kind of supervised learning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Independent natural extension for choice functions</title>
      <link>https://arthurvancamp.github.io/journal/ijar2023/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We introduce an independence notion for choice functions, which we call &amp;rsquo;epistemic independence&amp;rsquo; following the work by De Cooman et al. (2011) for lower previsions, and study it in a multivariate setting. This work is a continuation of earlier work of one of the authors, and our results build on the characterization of choice functions in terms of sets of binary preferences recently established by De Bock and De Cooman (2018). We obtain the many-to-one independent natural extension in this framework. Given the generality of choice functions, our expression for the independent natural extension is the most general one we are aware of, and we show how it implies the independent natural extension for sets of desirable gambles, and therefore also for less expressive imprecise-probabilistic models. Once this is in place, we compare this concept of epistemic independence to another independence concept for choice functions proposed by Seidenfeld (2010), which De Bock and De Cooman (2021) have called S-independence. We show that neither is more general than the other.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Exposing some points of interest about non-exposed points of desirability</title>
      <link>https://arthurvancamp.github.io/journal/ijar2022/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We study the representation of sets of desirable gambles by sets of probability mass functions. Sets of desirable gambles are a very general uncertainty model, that may be non-Archimedean, and therefore not representable by a set of probability mass functions. Recently, Cozman (2018) has shown that imposing the additional requirement of even convexity on sets of desirable gambles guarantees that they are representable by a set of probability mass functions. Already more that 20 years earlier, Seidenfeld et al. (1995) gave an axiomatisation of binary preferences—on horse lotteries, rather than on gambles—that also leads to a unique representation in terms of sets of probability mass functions. To reach this goal, they use two devices, which we will call &amp;lsquo;SSK–Archimedeanity&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;SSK–extension&amp;rsquo;. In this paper, we will make the arguments of Seidenfeld et al. (1995) explicit in the language of gambles, and show how their ideas imply even convexity and allow for conservative reasoning with evenly convex sets of desirable gambles, by deriving an equivalence between the SSK–Archimedean natural extension, the SSK–extension, and the evenly convex natural extension.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Modelling epistemic irrelevance with choice functions</title>
      <link>https://arthurvancamp.github.io/journal/ijar2020/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We consider coherent choice functions under the recent axiomatisation proposed by De Bock and de Cooman that guarantees a representation in terms of binary preferences, and we discuss how to define conditioning in this framework. In a multivariate context, we propose a notion of marginalisation, and its inverse operation called weak (cylindrical) extension. We combine this with our definition of conditioning to define a notion of irrelevance, and we obtain the irrelevant natural extension in this framework: the least informative choice function that satisfies a given irrelevance assessment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Optimal control of a linear system subject to partially specified input noise</title>
      <link>https://arthurvancamp.github.io/journal/ijrnc2019/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the most basic problems in control theory is that of controlling a discrete-time linear system subject to uncertain noise with the objective of minimizing the expectation of a quadratic cost. If one assumes the noise to be white, then solving this problem is relatively straightforward. However, white noise is arguably unrealistic: noise is not necessarily independent, and one does not always precisely know its expectation. We first recall the optimal control policy without assuming independence and show that, in this case, computing the optimal control inputs becomes infeasible. In the next step, we assume only the knowledge of lower and upper bounds on the conditional expectation of the noise and prove that this approach leads to tight lower and upper bounds on the optimal control inputs. The analytical expressions that determine these bounds are strikingly similar to the usual expressions for the case of white noise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Exchangeable choice functions</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We investigate how to model exchangeability with choice functions.&#xA;Exchangeability is a structural assessment on a sequence of uncertain variables.&#xA;We show how such assessments constitute a special kind of indifference assessment, and how this idea leads to a counterpart of de Finetti’s Representation Theorem, both in a finite and a countable context.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Coherent choice functions, desirability and indifference</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We investigate how to model indifference with choice functions.&#xA;We take the coherence axioms for choice functions proposed by Seidenfeld, Schervisch and Kadane as a source of inspiration, but modify them to strengthen the connection with desirability.&#xA;We discuss the properties of choice functions that are coherent under our modified set of axioms and the connection with desirability.&#xA;Once this is in place, we present an axiomatisation of indifference in terms of desirability.&#xA;On this we build our definition of indifference in terms of choice functions, which we discuss in some detail.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Lexicographic choice functions</title>
      <link>https://arthurvancamp.github.io/journal/ijar2018a/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We investigate a generalisation of the coherent choice functions considered by Seidenfeld et al. (2010), by sticking to the convexity axiom but imposing no Archimedeanity condition.&#xA;We define our choice functions on vector spaces of options, which allows us to incorporate as special cases both Seidenfeld et al.’s (2010) choice functions on horse lotteries and also pairwise choice—which is equivalent to sets of desirable gambles (Quaeghebeur, 2014)—, and to investigate their connections.&#xA;We show that choice functions based on sets of desirable options (gambles) satisfy Seidenfeld’s convexity axiom only for very particular types of sets of desirable options, which are exactly those that are representable by lexicographic probability systems that have no non-trivial Savage-null events.&#xA;We call them lexicographic choice functions.&#xA;Finally, we prove that these choice functions can be used to determine the most conservative convex choice function associated with a given binary relation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Characterizing Dirichlet priors</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The selection of prior distributions is a problem that has been heavily discussed since Bayes and Price published their paper in 1763.&#xA;Conjugate priors became popular, largely because of their mathematical convenience.&#xA;In this study, we justify the use of the conjugate combination of a Dirich- let prior and a multinomial likelihood by imposing a fundamental principle that we call partition invariance, alongside other requirements that are well known in the literature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Representation theorems for partially exchangeable random variables</title>
      <link>https://arthurvancamp.github.io/journal/fss2016/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We provide representation theorems for both ﬁnite and countable sequences of ﬁnite-valued random variables that are considered to be partially exchangeable.&#xA;In their most general form, our results are presented in terms of sets of desirable gambles, a very general framework for modelling uncertainty.&#xA;Its key advantages are that it allows for imprecision, is more expressive than almost every other imprecise-probabilistic framework and makes conditioning on events with (lower) probability zero non-problematic.&#xA;We translate our results to more conventional, although less general frameworks as well: lower previsions, linear previsions and probability measures.&#xA;The usual, precise-probabilistic representation theorems for partially exchangeable random variables are obtained as special cases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
