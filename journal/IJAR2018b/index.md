## Abstract
We investigate how to model exchangeability with choice functions.
Exchangeability is a structural assessment on a sequence of uncertain variables.
We show how such assessments constitute a special kind of indifference assessment, and how this idea leads to a counterpart of de Finettiâ€™s Representation Theorem, both in a finite and a countable context.
