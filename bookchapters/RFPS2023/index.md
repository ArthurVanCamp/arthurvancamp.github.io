## Abstract
We study whether it is possible to generalise Seidenfeld et al.’s representation result for coherent choice functions in terms of sets of probability/utility pairs when we let go of Archimedeanity.
We show that the convexity property is necessary but not sufficient for a choice function to be an infimum of a class of lexicographic ones.
For the special case of two-dimensional option spaces, we determine the necessary and sufficient conditions by weakening the Archimedean axiom.
