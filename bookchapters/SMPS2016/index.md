## Abstract
We investigate the connection between choice functions and lexicographic probabilities, by means of the convexity axiom considered by Seidenfeld et al. (2010) but without imposing any Archimedean condition.
We show that lexicographic probabilities are related to a particular type of sets of desirable gambles, and investigate the properties of the coherent choice function this induces via maximality.
Finally, we show that the convexity axiom is necessary but not sufficient for a coherent choice function to be the infimum of a class of lexicographic ones.
