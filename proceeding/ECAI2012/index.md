## Abstract
We summarise and provide pointers to recent advances in inference and identification for specific types of probabilistic graphical models using imprecise probabilities.
Robust inferences can be made in so-called credal networks when the local models attached to their nodes are imprecisely specified as conditional lower previsions, by using exact algorithms whose complexity is comparable to that for the precise-probabilistic counterparts.
