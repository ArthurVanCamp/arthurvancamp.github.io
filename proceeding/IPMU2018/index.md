## Abstract
We extend the notion of natural extension, that gives the least committal extension of a given assessment, from the theory of sets of desirable gambles to that of choice functions.
We give an expression of this natural extension and characterise its existence by means of a property called avoiding complete rejection.
We prove that our notion reduces indeed to the standard one in the case of choice functions determined by binary comparisons, and that these are not general enough to determine all coherent choice function.
Finally, we investigate the compatibility of the notion of natural extension with the structural assessment of indifference between a set of options.
